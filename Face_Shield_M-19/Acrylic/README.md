# Face Shield ACRYLIC #

## BoM ##

1. HEAD BAND : Acrylic sheet, between 3mm to 5mm thick, (GREEN lines are living hinges, RED is Engraved Text)
2. SHIELD : OHP Transparency Film, A4 Size, 175 microns thick (100 microns works)
    If you need a longer shield, use A3 sheet, and trim length as needed
3. RETENTION : Elastic Band or similar for retention, approx. 200 mm / 8 inches long
4. OPTIONAL : Foam strip, adhesive. To be stuck on the inside surface that touches forehead, for long duration comfort (not essential)


## ASSEMBLY ##

1. Laser Cut the Acrylic head band.
2. Soak in Soap water for 30 minutes, and then in clean water for 30 minutes.
3. Air dry in the Sun.
4. Apply surgical plaster tape over the living hinges. This allows the band to be used if the living hinges break (Acrylic is brittle). We have used broken bands for over 8 hours at a stretch wthout problems. If you'd like to avoid this step altogether, take a look at the foam board design.
5. Attach the elastic retention band.
6. Apply foam along the area which comes in contact with the forehead. We used 2mm thick adhesive backed foam strips - about 10-15mm wide (approx 1/2 inch) and 200mm long (8 inches). This improves comfort over extended hours of use, but can be skipped, especially if the shield is already worn over other gear such as caps.
7. Snap fit the clear OHP film shields. If you're shipping these, you can pack the head bands and OHP films separately and the end user's can easily assemble before use.
